# APC
The objective was to develop a command-line calculator capable of performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on arbitrarily large numbers that exceed standard data type limits. The solution uses doubly linked lists to store and manipulate each digit, enabling calculations with numbers of any length.
